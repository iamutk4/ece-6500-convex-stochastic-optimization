This repository containts 5 folders, consisting of 4 problem sets (PS1 - PS4), and a final project. Topic of discussion in each folder is as follows:

1. PS1: Existence of Xopt, GM (Gradient Descent Method) for non-convex functions, for convex non-Lipschitz gradient function, for linear regression, convex sets, convex functions, logistic regression convexity, and GM implementation-investigation (MALTAB)

2. PS2: Necessary/Sufficient Conditions for Local/Global Optimality, Positive/Negative (Semi) Definiteness of Symmetric Matrices, convex functions, Optimality Conditions for Constrained Optimization, Equivalent Problems, Convex Problem Formulation, Uniqueness of Projection onto a Convex set, Pure Newton Method, and Multi-Step Method Implementation-Investigation (MATLAB)

3. PS3: Strong Duality, Optimal Primal-Dual Pairs, Lagrangian Duality, Multiple Duals of the same Primal, Convexity and Duality, KKT Conditions, Dual Formulation and Solution, and Gradient-Projection Method Implementation (MATLAB)

4. PS4: Communication network, joint congestion control for utility maximization, rate allocation for optimal routing problem under the power constrained network setting, function and develop the gradient-based algorithm for the problem designed, develop the associated gradient method by associaing Lagrangian multiplier, Markov chain, Foster-Lyapunov criterion, global balance equations, Dual Algorithm, Primal-Dual Algorithm, and Heavy-Ball Method (MATLAB)
